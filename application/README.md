# SocialNetwork

- This is bill's version of the combined branch.
- The runEXE.bat should work if you have the JavaFX lib in the c:\temp\ directory as listed in the .bat
- It has the buttons with different colors
- A stub for Shortest Path call is in the SocialNetworkManager.java
- The public methods for add/remove user/connection need to have these commands logged.
- File Load works properly
- Does not seem like File Save works properly
