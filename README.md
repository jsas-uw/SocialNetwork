# SocialNetwork
Created "Combined" branch with all files

Modified the menu/cmdEnum to include remaining functions

Todo:
- use the graph to populate the flow panes
(right now the buttons are all from hardcoded lists)
- Make the buttons work
- Remy has to add a final function for the SocialNetworkADT to get Shortest path between friends

Thoughts: to avoid dealing with resizing the circular pane for friends we could do everything in center. Right now the show all users option opens in the right pane. 

# Graph

*Removed Cycle detection from the graph classes

I made a repo for my graph program. 
Since its not using hash tables it may be 
better to use a different graph program as 
the base as long as its not missing
a function we need for the social network.
