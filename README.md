# SocialNetwork
Added Bill's main method from canvas files

Modified the border pane to mock up the GUI

Todo:
- use the graph to populate the flow panes
(right now the buttons are all from hardcoded lists)
- Make the buttons work
- Remy has to add a final function for the SocialNetworkADT to get Shortest path between friends

# Graph
https://github.com/jsas-uw/p4-graph
I made a repo for my graph program. 
Since its not using hash tables it may be 
better to use a different graph program as 
the base as long as its not missing
a function we need for the social network.
