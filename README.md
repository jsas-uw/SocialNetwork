# SocialNetwork
Added Will's main method from canvas files
Modified the border pane to mock up the GUI

Todo:
add the graph data structure
parse input files into the graph
use the graph to populate the flow panes
(right now the buttons are all from hardcoded lists)
Make the buttons work

# Graph
https://github.com/jsas-uw/p4-graph
I made a repo for my graph program. 
Since its not using hash tables it may be 
better to use a different graph program as 
the base as long as its not missing
a function we need for the social network.
