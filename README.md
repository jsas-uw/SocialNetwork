# SocialNetwork
Downloaded the main branch and merged Remy's changes. 
Idea is to merge all the latest changes to the "Combined" branch.


Todo:
- Final checks: review assignment/rubric to make sure we have everything
- Bottom pane: check that we have all status messages and hook the counters up to the graph


# Graph

*Removed Cycle detection and directionality from the graph classes

I made a repo for my graph program. 
Since its not using hash tables it may be 
better to use a different graph program as 
the base as long as its not missing
a function we need for the social network.
